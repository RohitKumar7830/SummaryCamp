      At DharmaAwakening Camp, our mission is to introduce children aged 10-14 to Sanatana Dharma, Yoga, and Meditation through an engaging 5-day immersive experience from August 10 to August 15, 2025, in Connecticut. By blending cultural and historical learnings with games, team projects, and interactive activities, we aim to create a fun and transformative environment that fosters mindfulness, self-discovery, and a deep connection to Indian heritage. Organized by a dedicated group of volunteers, this initiative is a stepping stone toward expanding the camp into a multi-week experience, inspiring the next generation to embrace their roots and grow with confidence.
